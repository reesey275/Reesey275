# DevOnboarder

**Status:** Active Development | **Repository:** Private

## Problem
Service onboarding across the platform is inconsistent and wastes time recreating context.

## Approach
Centralize multi-service onboarding in a control plane that coordinates Discord intake,
hybrid Bash/Python automation, and guardrails that uphold a 95% quality bar.

**Architecture:** Multi-service control plane
**Stack:** Python, Shell, Discord API, GitHub Actions
**Quality Standard:** 95% completion threshold

## Your Role
- Program management and architecture design
- Automation framework development
- Discord bot integration and workflows
- Documentation and knowledge management

## Key Outcomes
- Faster contributor ramp-up across services
- Measurable quality thresholds with automated enforcement
- Reduced repeated onboarding blockers
- Centralized knowledge base with AAR integration

## Next Steps
- Complete hybrid runner migration (Bash → Python)
- Expand AAR coverage across all services
- Tune automation guardrails based on Discord feedback
- Implement self-documenting workflow capabilities
