# Profile Governance

This repository contains the GitHub Profile README for `reesey275`.

The profile is treated as a governed statement: claims should be verifiable by evidence in public artifacts (code, CI, docs, commit history) rather than aspirational language.

## Governance Rules

1. **Evidence-first**
   - Every substantive claim must map to at least one verifiable artifact:
     - Repository links
     - CI workflows / logs
     - Documentation (policies, checklists, standards)
     - Commit history (including signed commits)

2. **No aspirational claims**
   - Avoid "world-class", "expert", "best", "enterprise-grade" unless there is concrete, inspectable evidence.
   - Prefer: what exists, what is enforced, what is repeatable.

3. **Mechanical honesty over opinion**
   - Preference is given to enforceable constraints:
     - CI gates
     - linters / formatters
     - documentation validation
     - GPG-signed commits
     - public change history

4. **Change control**
   - Any profile change should be:
     - small and intentional
     - commit-scoped (one change per commit when practical)
     - accompanied by a short rationale in the commit message

## Review Cadence

- **Last Reviewed:** 2025-12-18
- **Next Review Due:** 2026-01-18 (30-day cold review)

During review:
- Remove or tighten any claim that lacks evidence
- Update links if structure changes
- Confirm "Featured Projects" reflect the current reality

## External Review (Optional)

If an independent reviewer is available in the future, record:
- reviewer handle/name (with consent)
- review date
- requested edits (if any)
- approval statement

Until then, accountability is established through public auditability and mechanical enforcement.
